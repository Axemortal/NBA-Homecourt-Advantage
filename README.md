# Background

At the height of the pandemic, during the NBA bubble, Damian Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers sank a deep three, effectively knocking out the Dallas Mavericks. He was on fire that day, scoring 60 over points. However, there was no cheer, no sound. This strange moment occurred during COVID, and made us wonder - what happens when no team has the audience on their side, when no team is the home team?

## Discovering the factors affecting Home Court Advantage

Home court advantage is a well-documented phenomenon in the NBA, where teams playing on their home court tend to have a significantly higher win percentage compared to playing on the road. This advantage raises intriguing questions about the factors that contribute to this statistical difference and how they might influence the outcome of NBA games and series.
